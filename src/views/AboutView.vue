      <p>
        Hello! I'm Xavi Fortes, a Junior DevOps Engineer with a passion for
        building and maintaining robust infrastructures and developing efficient
        software solutions. With a background in multiplatform application
        development and microcomputer systems and networks, I've honed my skills
        in various areas of cloud computing, automation, and programming
        languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my current role at Unisys, I handle infrastructure maintenance in
        Azure, utilizing technologies like SQL DB, Functions, and App Service.
        Additionally, I've contributed to internal projects using .Net, Entity
        Framework, and Blazor, empowering our team to streamline processes and
        enhance productivity. Prior to this, at Allfunds Bank SAU, I gained
        hands-on experience in AWS infrastructure maintenance with Terraform,
        Docker, Kubernetes, and troubleshooting through Jira.
      </p>
      <p>
        My expertise spans across AWS, Azure, GCP, alongside proficiency in
        Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, and scripting in bash/shell. I'm fluent
        in languages like C#, Java, Python, and SQL, and have dabbled in
        frontend technologies like JavaScript, TypeScript, and React. My
        continuous learning journey includes certifications in cybersecurity,
        networking, and courses from reputable institutions like Cisco and
        Universidad Francisco de Vitoria.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of work, I'm an avid tech enthusiast, constantly exploring new
        technologies and setting up personal projects. I've built a HomeLab
        environment with virtual machines, including a Kubernetes K3S cluster,
        showcased on my website. From hosting game servers to managing home
        automation systems, I love experimenting with cutting-edge tools and
        platforms like AWS, GCP, and Azure to bring my ideas to life.
